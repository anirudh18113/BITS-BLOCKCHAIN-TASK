# BITS-BLOCKCHAIN-TASK
DESCRIPTION OF QuestionBank.sol -----
Created a structure which composed of an array and a map.
Two fields requiredQuestions and Total Questions were suited for the task.
Function add- checks if the random value is already present, if not then adds it and marks the status true
and if found skips that question.
Function random - creates a random set of Question number .
Nonce is used for the generation of the random number.
Push Question adds number of question till the requiredQuestion limit is reached.
returnQuestion returns the set.
Idea behind using map was uniqueness of randomly generated numbers through the Function Random.


I tried to integrate it with flutter but was facing errors and did not go for WebApp as I have no prior experience in WebDevelopment.
